Clone the repository
As before, you should clone the Scrapy repository.

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy.git
Install the required libraries
In the scrapy/docs directory, there's a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python libraries you need to build the documentation. You can install these with pip.

shell
Copy code
cd scrapy/docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
Build the documentation
Use the provided make command to build the HTML documentation.

shell
Copy code
make html
This will generate the documentation in the build/html directory.

To view the documentation in your default browser, use:

shell
Copy code
make htmlview
If you want to clean up all generated documentation files and start from scratch, use:

shell
Copy code
make clean
And if you want to recreate the documentation automatically when you make changes, you first need to install watchdog:

shell
Copy code
pip install watchdog
Then you can use:

shell
Copy code
make watch
Alternatively, you can use tox to compile the documentation:

shell
Copy code
tox -e docs
This will generate the documentation in the .tox/docs/tmp/html directory.

Now, if you want to convert the generated HTML documentation to PDF, you'll need to follow the wkhtmltopdf step from the previous guide:

Install wkhtmltopdf
You can download wkhtmltopdf from this link: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html. Make sure to add wkhtmltopdf to your PATH during the installation process.

Convert HTML to PDF
Navigate to the build/html directory and convert the index.html to PDF:

shell
Copy code
cd build/html
wkhtmltopdf index.html output.pdf
This will give you a PDF version of the Scrapy documentation.
Please note that this process will only convert the index.html page to a PDF. If you want to convert all the pages, you might need to write a script to iterate over all HTML files in the directory and convert them one by one.
